## What is a Multiple Bar Graph?  

A multiple bar graph, also known as a grouped bar graph or multiple bar chart, is a visualization tool that represents multiple data sets side by side using separate bars within the same category. Unlike stacked bar graphs, where data sets are layered on top of each other, this type of graph places bars for each data set adjacent to one another, making it easier to compare data across categories.
