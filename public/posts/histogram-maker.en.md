## What is a Histogram chart?

A histogram is a type of chart used to visually represent the distribution of a dataset. It offers a clear and immediate summary of how frequently different values occur within the data. The x-axis of the histogram is used to display the range of values, which is divided into intervals or "bins." On the other hand, the y-axis shows the number or frequency of data points that fall into each bin. Each vertical bar in the histogram represents one of these bins, and its height corresponds to the number of data points within that particular range. Histograms are particularly effective for detecting patterns, trends, and outliers in the dataset. They are commonly used in data analysis, scientific studies, and data visualization to better understand the central tendencies and variations within the dataset.

## Why is a Histogram Useful?

Histograms are a powerful tool for illustrating data distribution. While various statistical measures such as minimum, maximum, average, median, mode, and standard deviation can be computed, a histogram offers a more straightforward and intuitive insight into how data is distributed across different values.
