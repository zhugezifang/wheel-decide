## What Is a Stacked Bar Chart?

A stacked bar chart is a variation of the standard bar chart. In this chart type, data can be displayed as adjacent horizontal bars or stacked vertical bars. Each bar represents a total value, which is broken down into smaller sub-values, allowing for detailed insights into the data.

In a stacked bar chart, the same categories across all bars are represented by identical colors. This format makes it easy to compare both the overall total and the individual components of each bar, as demonstrated in the example data below.

Stacked bar charts are particularly useful for tracking changes in data over time, as they allow users to identify where increases or decreases occur. A common application of this type of chart is tracking the fluctuations in the value of investments within a stock portfolio over a given period.

One variation of the stacked bar chart is the 100% stacked bar chart. In this format, all bars have an equal height or length, with each section representing a percentage of the total bar instead of absolute values.

## How to Create a Stacked Bar Chart in Google Sheets?

**Step 1: Prepare Your Data**  
Begin by importing your data into Google Sheets and organizing it properly. Ensure you create clear headers for each column in the first row, as these labels are vital for generating a coherent chart.
