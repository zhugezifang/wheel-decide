## What is a Segmented Bar Graph?

A segmented bar graph is a type of chart that visually represents data by using bars to display information across different categories or groups. In this graph, each bar is divided into multiple segments, with each segment corresponding to a sub-category or specific value within the larger category. The main goal of a segmented bar graph is to illustrate how a whole is divided into its individual components, showing both the overall total and the distribution of each part. The length of each segment within a bar is directly proportional to the value it represents, and all segments are stacked together to indicate the total value for each category.

Segmented bar graphs are especially useful when you need to emphasize the relationship between the whole and its parts. They are particularly effective for displaying complex data sets that contain multiple dimensions or elements, providing an easy way to compare different categories. These graphs help to convey both the individual values within smaller sub-categories and the overall breakdown of data across the main categories.
